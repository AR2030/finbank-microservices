## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **Transaction Service**
   - Risk: Data consistency across services
   - Mitigation: Saga pattern, extensive testing
   - Timeline impact: +2 weeks buffer

2. **Fraud Detection**
   - Risk: False positives affecting UX
   - Mitigation: Tunable thresholds, manual review
   - Timeline impact: +1 week buffer

3. **Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Risk: PCI compliance complexity
   - Mitigation: Use hosted payment pages initially
   - Timeline impact: +1 week buffer

4. **Mobile App**
   - Risk: Platform-specific issues
   - Mitigation: Start with cross-platform (React Native)
   - Timeline impact: +2 weeks buffer

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Open Banking Compliance**
   - Risk: Regulatory requirements vary by region
   - Mitigation: Focus on one standard first (PSD2 or UK OB)

2. **Multi-tenancy**
   - Risk: Performance degradation
   - Mitigation: Proper resource isolation, monitoring
